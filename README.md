## What It Does

SaaSBooks connects directly to your Stripe and Mercury accounts to:

- **Import and categorize** transactions automatically
- **Calculate SaaS metrics** like MRR, customer acquisition cost, and burn rate
- **Generate visualizations** that show your business health at a glance
- **Prepare exports** for your accountant or tax software
- **Store everything locally** as simple JSON files you can version control

## Why Open Source?

We believe financial tools should be:

1. **Transparent** - You should know exactly how your financial data is processed
2. **Customizable** - Every SaaS business has unique needs
3. **Affordable** - Financial clarity shouldn't cost $300/month
